School Donation System Project

Authors: Alex Frazier, Shinie Shaw
Start Date: 1/15/19

Goal is to create an MVP by end of February 2019.
Let Shinie work with teachers, parents, and students to learn pain points and help us create a better system.
Then ultimately let customer feedback, work requirements, and product value decide feature/product roadmap.
